# cpp-brawl
First Brawl Stars open source private server made in c++! 
# how2play
for Android, install cxxdroid from playstore, open Program.cpp and run it
for Pc or others, compile it then run it
# remark
this is a sample server that I made while learning c++, basically it is a server base.
it's whole code is by me except for CsvHelper.h
I made my best to only use built in libraries
